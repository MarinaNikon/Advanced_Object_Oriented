#Word Cloud


	This is a 'Generating a Word Cloud' program. Word-clouds are a mechanism for creating a visual representation of text
and are used to display a visual summary of the most important words used on a web page, a news forum or a social media web site.
A word-cloud is comprised of a set of tags, with each tag representing a single word. The importance of a word is typically
estimated from its occurrence frequency in a text and is visualised using a large font size or different font colour. And with the 
help of this program a user may parse a file or a URL to generate a PNG file with a word-cloud displaying the most prominent words
in decreasing font size, style and colour. Whit the help of menu the user with may  choose option that suits him. 
And create to create a PNG file from text or URL. Only words that are not in the file ignorewords.txt are added to the PNG file.
